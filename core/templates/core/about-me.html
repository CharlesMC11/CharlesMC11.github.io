      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, hello! I'm Charles (he/him), a recent graduate based in the Bay
        Area, California. I firmly believe that art and technology go hand in
        hand in creating authentic stories and impactful experiences. I love
        learning new things and solving problems, and I hope to use my skills
        to realize people's artistic visions.
      <p>
        In my free time, I love writing journals, taking photos, and building
        Legos.
