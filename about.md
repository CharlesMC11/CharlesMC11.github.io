Hello, hello! I'm Charles (he/him), a recent graduate based in the Bay Area, California. I firmly believe that art and technology go hand in hand in creating authentic stories and impactful experiences. I love learning new things and solving problems, and I hope to use my skills to realize people's artistic visions.

In my free time, I love writing journals, taking photos, and building Legos.
